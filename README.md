# Saboteur

A tool to disrupt and change the behavior of a running spring based applications. This can be used to fully test Distributed Spring Boot applications. 

For example: 
- What is happening when a tier One service is no more available ?
- How do my application behave when the database is down ?  
- Is my application handling correctly retry mechanism ? 

Those cases are traditionnaly difficult to test because it is not easy to isolate parts of the application.
